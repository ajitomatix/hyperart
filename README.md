# hyperart
HyperArt is a program to view and create repeating hyperbolic patterns using algorithm developed by Dr Douglas Dunham. The patterns are similar to those created by the venerable Dutch artist M. C. Escher. While this might not be of immediate practical use, it is very interesting from mathematical and artistic viewpoints.
